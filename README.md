Creating a terraform environment using terraform ---
Ec2 and S3 bucket

Very basic terraform code with vulnerabilities


Checkov tool will catch vulnerabilities before deployment the infrastructure--
We will implement cloudsploit to detect any vulnerability post deploying the infra for any open vulnerabilities..
